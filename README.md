## Description
The 'Trivia Project' is a client-server trivia game.

The repository contains a server project written in c++, and a client ui written in C#.

Both the server and client use scripts written in python.

Using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) tunneling services, the server is exposed to the WAN.

## Notes
The project uses the following python packages:
1. requests
2. json
3. html
4. sys
5. sqlite3
6. subprocess
7. time
8. socket
9. gspread


* Note that the visual studio sln projects might not work in the final version, due to incorrect paths.
